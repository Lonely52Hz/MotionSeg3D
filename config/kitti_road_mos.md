# KITTI-Road-MOS 

To enrich the dataset in the moving object segmentation (MOS) task and to reduce the gap of different data distributions between the validation and test sets in the existing SemanticKITTI-MOS dataset, we automatically annotated and manually corrected the [KITTI-Road](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/raw_data.php?type=road) dataset.


The correspondence of the data is as follows:
```
raw_id -> seq_id
2011_09_26_drive_0015 -> 30
2011_09_26_drive_0027 -> 31
2011_09_26_drive_0028 -> 32
2011_09_26_drive_0029 -> 33
2011_09_26_drive_0032 -> 34
2011_09_26_drive_0052 -> 35
2011_09_26_drive_0070 -> 36
2011_09_26_drive_0101 -> 37
2011_09_29_drive_0004 -> 38
2011_09_30_drive_0016 -> 39
2011_10_03_drive_0042 -> 40
2011_10_03_drive_0047 -> 41
```
